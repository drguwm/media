.ve-header "George Inness's 'A Marine'"
George Inness depicts the seaside as beauty to be seen in caution, as the choppiness of the water depicted in his vigorous brushstrokes gives light of the sea's dramatic nature. Beyond the greens and grays of the grim weather can be seen an orange and yellow illumination of the sun, accentuating distant ships in the harbor of a town across the water. Inness brings life to the canvas with the textures of the boulders along the shore, allowing the viewer to know the wet patches from the dry, as well as the ability to portray algae on the rocky surface. The overall moodiness of the painting provides captivation through the energy and excitment of danger, as well as the muted romantic color palette allowing wariness to be beautiful.
