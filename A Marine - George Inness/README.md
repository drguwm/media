.ve-header "George Inness's 'A Marine'"
George Inness depicts the seaside as beauty to be seen in caution, as the choppiness of the water depicted in his vigorous brushstrokes gives light of the sea's dramatic nature. Beyond the greens and grays of the grim weather can be seen an orange and yellow illumination of the sun, accentuating distant ships in the harbor of a town across the water. Inness brings life to the canvas with the textures of the boulders along the shore, allowing the viewer to know the wet patches from the dry, as well as the ability to portray algae on the rocky surface. The overall moodiness of the painting provides captivation through the energy and excitment of danger, as well as the muted romantic color palette allowing wariness to be beautiful. 
#Contrasting Another Inness Landscape
George Inness sought to use painting as poetry, and aspired not to capture a landscape as seen by the naked eye, but to portray the many moods of mother nature. The artist would say that "the true purpose of the painter is simply to reproduce in other minds the impression which a scene has made upon him... to awaken emotion," (Art Institute of Chicago). In other words, his landscapes were an effort to show people how the world around him made him feel.

In *The Home of the Heron,* Inness shows us a golden view of Florida, complete with a soft brush of trees and tall grass. The style of this painting is much smoother in texture than that of *The Marine*, much less rigid and sharp. The brush strokes are blended together to create a foggy glow and a much more calming sensation. The heron is surrounded by a glow of orange, and is portrayed as a silhouette standing tall with wings extended and beak pointing upward, showing us how majestic and powerful nature is. The overall tone of the portrait is quiet, calm stillness in nature in contrast to the energetic, roaring ocean portrayed in *The Marine.* The color palette is also opposite, with oranges, browns, and yellows being the uplifting choice as opposed to the blues, greys, and black brooding over the sea.
