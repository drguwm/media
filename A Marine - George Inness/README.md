.ve-header "Landscape Paintings of George Inness"
==George Inness=={Q704868} sought to use painting as poetry, and aspired not to capture a landscape as seen by the naked eye, but to portray the many moods of mother nature. The artist would say that "the true purpose of the painter is simply to reproduce in other minds the impression which a scene has made upon him... to awaken emotion," (==Art Institute of Chicago=={Q239303}). In other words, his landscapes were an effort to expound his conception of the world around him.

#A Marine
.ve-media https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/68792/manifest.json right
In his seascape painting* A Marine*, George Inness depicts the ocean as beauty to be seen in caution, which is exemplified by the choppiness of the water depicted in his vigorous brushstrokes, drawing attention to the sea's dramatic nature. Beyond the greens and grays of the grim weather can be seen an orange and yellow illumination of the sun, accentuating distant ships in the harbor of a town across the water. Inness brings life to the canvas with the rough textures of the boulders along the shore, allowing the viewer to perceive the wet patches from the dry, as well as the miry algae on the rocky surface. The overall moodiness of the painting captivates the viewers with the energy and excitment of dangerous waters and a muted, romantic color palette to show caution and beauty. It is as if Inness is being humbled by the awesome power of nature, and is attempting to elucidate this feeling of modesty.

#The Home of the Heron

In *The Home of the Heron,* Inness shows us a golden view of Florida, complete with a soft brush of trees and tall grass. The style of this painting is much smoother in texture than that of *The Marine*, contrary to the rigidness and sharpness of the seascape. The brush strokes are blended together to create a foggy glow and a much more calming sensation. The heron is surrounded by a glow of orange, and is portrayed as a silhouette standing tall with wings extended and beak pointing upward, showing us how majestic and powerful nature is. Its sprawled body and stretched neck seem as if we can almost hear its soft calls. The overall tone of the portrait is quiet and calm, expressing the stillness in nature with the only life being the viewer and the heron. The color palette also opposes *A Marine*, with oranges, browns, and yellows evoking an uplifting, soothing sensation contrasting the blues, greys, and black brooding over the sea.
#The Hudson River School and Industrial Revolution

==The Hudson River School=={Q943853} was a movement of lanscape artists who collectively believe in the romanticism of nature, and heavily postulated that these paintings were a reflection of God's work. This was the first recognized artistic fraternity in the United States, with George Inness being one of the most notable members. After the Civil War, Inness assisted in the shift of landscape painting aesthetics to a more similar style of French "plein-air" after he gained experience at the ==Barbizon School=={Q143357}, which is similar to the Hudson River School. This softer, more intimate style of landscape can be noted in his works such as *The Home of the Heron* and ==*Harvest, Montclair, New Jersey.*=={Q20268733}

Landscape painting in the United States during the Industrial Revolution was meant to embrace the natural beauty that was presented to the American people during a time of modernity and change. *==The Lackawanna Valley=={Q7745074}* is one painting that clearly emphasizes the tension between industrialization and naturalism during this time, showing an elegant landscape being disrupted by a booming train. Smoke seeps into the skies from the train and the factories in the town, railroads cut through the submissive lands, and tree trunks are scattered like a graveyard of a once great forest. This painting shows an additional internal struggle between pride in progress and remorse for the harm done to God's work. On one hand, there are new inventions that are incredible reflections of what the human mind is capable of, and on the other, the natural beauty of the land is being destroyed. The only person in the painting is laid out in a relaxed position, watching the mountains, but simultaneously being bombarded by the blairing and destructive train. It shows that there is change, and all there is to do is be a spectator during this transition of life. 
#People and Nature

As the storm rolls in, the only person in the painting lays down in a relaxed position and watches the clouds turn grey, unmoved by his sheep motioning toward him in a flee from the hazard. Possibly, he sits in acceptance of his fate or without a care; on the other hand, it can be that he is posed in awe of the power that nature holds above him. His disposition of relaxation is the same as the man in *The Lackawanna Valley* while the noisy train rushes towards him, functioning the same as the weather in *The Storm.*

Many Inness landscapes include a quaint agricultural setting, or a person out and about in nature. This promotes the romantic concept of living with nature rather than against it, as it is something that people are blessed with. Farms, cottages, and other rural buildings and structures were typical to French landscape painting at this time, which is something Inness adapted into his work after time at the Barbizon School. In *The Old Mill,* it is still seen that there is this uncertainty with cultivating land, although not as extreme as in places where there is more industry. Inness found romanticism in peasantry and rural life, and that impression is not hindered here. Yet, there is still caution depicted through the contrast of a dark forest and a illuminated old mill. The people play and lounge in the sun with their dog, while across the subtle stream is the mill, a safe place for them to return before the caution of the woods.
